# Zach's Updated Fork of RFChairs
An up-to-date fork of RFChairs for Spigot/Paper 1.15

## Why fork RFChairs?
RFChairs is an amazing resource. For most servers, this is a core feature. Other chair plugins are extremely old, and hardly maintained. Seeing RFChairs being abandoned, it's safe to assume it will only recieve bare minimum updates (if any) to keep it alive. This fork aims to have maximum compatibility with the current RFChairs while being updated for 1.15. <3
